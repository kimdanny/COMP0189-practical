# COMP0189-practical

## Week 1 (Environment set up)
Although you can run practial codes without virtual environment, we recommend setting it up.
You have two options:

1) using Anaconda:  
- [Anaconda Guide](https://github.com/kimdanny/COMP0189-practical/blob/main/Week-01/Anaconda.md)
- [Anaconda Guide for M1/M2 MacBooks](https://github.com/kimdanny/COMP0189-practical/blob/main/Week-01/Anaconda_for_M1.md)

2) using python `virtualenv`:  
- [Python VirtualEnv](https://github.com/kimdanny/COMP0189-practical/blob/main/Week-01/Virtualenv.md)

If you do not wish to set up a local environment or run it online for initial experiments, you can open the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and search for this repository (https://github.com/kimdanny/COMP0189-practical) to open and run.
