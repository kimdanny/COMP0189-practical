# PRoNTo Tutorials

## Lab Demo

1. Follow the lab demo or the steps described in the PRoNTo OASIS tutorial to classify demented patients versus non-demented based on their structural MRI (segmented grey matter images).  


2. Follow the lab demo or the steps described in the PRoNTo OASIS tutorial to predict the [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini–Mental_State_Examination) scores for the two groups together (demented and non-demented) and also for each group individually from their structural MRI (segmented grey matter images).  

    **Discussion**: Was it better to treat the problem as a classification or as a regression problem?  


3. Now repeat the exercises 1 and 2 using the low dimensional version of the data following the steps described in the PRoNTo OASIS tutorial. 

    **Discussion**: Was it better to use a high or low dimensional version of the data? 

 

## Homework

1. Try different strategies to improve the performance of the 4 models above, these could include: (1) try different machine learning models (note that for the low dimensional data it is possible to try non-kernel models as well), (2) try different cross-validation strategies; (3) try different range of hyper-parameters. 

    **Discussion**: Which strategy made the biggest impact on the models’ performance? 


2. Follow the steps described in Chapter 16 of the PRoNTo manual to use MKL classification classify demented patients versus non-demented based on their structural MRI (segmented grey matter images).  

    **Discussion**: Which brain regions contributes more to the predictions? 

 

3. Follow the steps described in Chapter 14 of the PRoNTo manual to predict age from structural MRI. 

    **Discussion**: Did the regression model for predicting age performed better than the regression model to predict MMSE? 


    (Optional) Follow the steps described in Chapter 13 using the Haxby data to classify the object category the subject is looking at (faces vs. houses).
